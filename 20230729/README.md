# 集市的故事

《大教堂与集市》一书对于“大教堂式”和“集市式”开发模式有了比较充分阐述和比较。此后，大家习惯将开源社区称呼为“集市”。

在这次分享中，将以小城镇的集市演变为切入点，探讨开源社区的一些问题。

The book "The Cathedral & the Bazaar" fully expounds and compares the development mode of "cathedral" and "bazaar". Since then, the open source community has been habitually regarded as a "bazaar".

In this sharing, we will take the evolution of the bazaar in small towns as a starting point to explore some problems in the open source community.
